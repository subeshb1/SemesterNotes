# Artificial Intelligence

## Definition

The definition of Artificial Intelligence varies along two dimension:

1.  Thought Processing and reasoning (top)
2.  Behavior (bottom)

And is MEasured in:

1.  Human Performance (left)
2.  Ideal Performance (right)

### 1. Acting Humanly (The Turing Test Approach)

- Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950.
- Provides a satisfactory operational definition of Intelligence.

#### Test

- Involves an Interrogator(Human) or judge, who interacts with onw human and one machine through written questions (chat).

#### Passing the Test

- In order for the machine to pass the test, the interrogator, after passing some written questions can't determine whether the answers came fro a human or a machine.

                        |   Human (Question)
                        |
                        |
       Interrogator     |-----------------------
                        |
                        |   Machine (Question)
                        |
                        |
                        |
```

In order for the machine to pass the test the required capabilities are:

1.  Natural Language Processing - to enable it to communicate in English.
2.  Knowledge Representation - to store what it knows or hears.
3.  Automated Reasoning - to use the stored information to answer questions and draw new conclusions.
4.  Machine Learning - to adapt to new circumstances and to detect pattern.

#### Total Turing Test

- Turing deliberately avoided any physical interaction between the machine and the interrogator because physical simulation of a a person is unnecessary for intelligence.
- Total Turing Test includes a video signal so that the interrogator can test the perceptual ability
- The extra capabilities to pass the test are:

  1.  computer vision: to perceive the environment.
  2.  robotics: to manipulate objects and move about.

- These six definitions compose most of AI.

### 2. Thinking Humanly (The Cognitive Modeling Approach)

- If we are going to say a given program thinks like human, we must have some way determining how human think.
- There are three ways:
  1.  Introspection - trying to catch our own thought as they go.
  2.  Psychological Experiments - observing a person in action.
  3.  Brain Imaging - observing the brain in action.
- Once we have sufficient `precise theory of mind`, it becomes efficient to express the theory as a computer program.
- In this approach we try to build or develop machine that match the corresponding be behavior of a human
- The interdisciplinary field of `cognitive science` brings together computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the working of the human wind.
- Example: Neural Network - concerned with simulating human problem solving and mental task processes in computer model.

### 3. Thinking Rationally (The laws of thought Approach)
